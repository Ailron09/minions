Here's a quick recap of what was done:\n\n1. **Task Recap**: You asked to open TextEdit and type 'Hello World!'.\n\n2. **Key Steps Taken**:\n   - I opened TextEdit to get it ready for typing.\n   - Then, I typed the phrase 'Hello World!' into the document.\n\n3. **Final Outcome**: The text 'Hello World!' is now typed into a new document in TextEdit, ready for you to save or edit further.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: You might want to save the document if you haven't already. You can do this by going to 'File' > 'Save' in the menu bar, and choosing a location and name for your file.\n\nIf you need any more help or have further tasks, feel free to ask. Have a great day! 😊",
