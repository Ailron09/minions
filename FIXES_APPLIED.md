# A2A-Minions Server Validation Fixes Applied

All the necessary fixes have been applied to resolve the validation errors. Here's what was fixed:

## 1. ValidationError Handling (Fixed in 3 places)
- **Line ~694 in _handle_send_task**: Changed from `raise ValidationError(f"Invalid task parameters: {e}")` to `raise e`
- **Line ~805 in _handle_get_task**: Changed from `raise ValidationError(f"Invalid get parameters: {e}")` to `raise e`  
- **Line ~833 in _handle_cancel_task**: Changed from `raise ValidationError(f"Invalid cancel parameters: {e}")` to `raise e`

## 2. Task Model Structure (Already correct)
- **create_task method**: Properly creates Task objects with:
  - `sessionId` field (required)
  - `history` field containing the message (required)
  - `status` as a TaskStatus object
  - `metadata` containing created_at and created_by

## 3. Data Access Fixes (Already correct)
- **execute_task**: Extracts message from `task["history"][0]`
- **update_task_status**: Creates proper TaskStatus objects
- **_cleanup_old_tasks**: Accesses created_at from `task.get("metadata", {}).get("created_at")`

## Next Steps

The error you're seeing suggests the server is still running with old code. Please:

1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server)

2. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   python apps/minions-a2a/run_server.py --port 8001 --api-key "abcd"
   ```

3. **Run the tests again**:
   ```bash
   python apps/minions-a2a/tests/test_client_minions.py
   ```

The validation errors should now be resolved. If you still see the same errors after restarting, please check:
- That you're running the server from the correct directory
- That there are no other instances of the server running on the same port
- That the file changes were saved properly
