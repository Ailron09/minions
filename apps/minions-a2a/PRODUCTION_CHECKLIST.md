A2A_RETENTION_HOURS="24"  # Task retention time
```

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] Configure HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Use reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) with SSL termination
- [ ] Disable HTTP in production

### 2. Security Hardening

#### Authentication Setup
- [ ] Generate strong JWT secret (minimum 32 bytes)
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly
- [ ] Implement API key rotation strategy
- [ ] Configure OAuth2 clients properly
- [ ] Remove default credentials

#### Network Security
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (nginx/cloudflare)
- [ ] Set up DDoS protection
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Enable security headers

#### Additional Security
- [ ] Run server as non-root user
- [ ] Use read-only filesystem where possible
- [ ] Implement request size limits
- [ ] Add request timeout at proxy level
- [ ] Enable audit logging

### 3. Infrastructure Requirements

#### Compute Resources
- [ ] CPU: Minimum 2 cores, recommended 4+ cores
- [ ] RAM: Minimum 4GB, recommended 8GB+
- [ ] Storage: 20GB+ for logs and temporary files
- [ ] Network: Low latency to LLM providers

#### Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.9+ installed
- [ ] All Python dependencies from requirements.txt
- [ ] Minions package installed
- [ ] PDF processing libraries (PyPDF2)

#### Container Deployment (Recommended)
```dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile structure
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
USER appuser
CMD ["python", "run_server.py", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting

#### Metrics Collection
- [ ] Set up Prometheus server
- [ ] Configure Prometheus scraping (every 30s)
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for:
  - Request rate and latency
  - Task execution metrics
  - Error rates
  - Resource utilization
  - Authentication failures

#### Log Management
- [ ] Configure structured logging
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (ELK/Loki)
- [ ] Implement log rotation
- [ ] Define log retention policy

#### Alerting Rules
- [ ] High error rate (>5% of requests)
- [ ] High response time (>10s p95)
- [ ] Memory usage >80%
- [ ] Task queue full
- [ ] Authentication failures spike
- [ ] PDF processing errors

### 5. Performance Optimization

#### Application Tuning
- [ ] Configure appropriate worker threads for PDF processing
- [ ] Tune connection pool sizes
- [ ] Optimize task retention settings
- [ ] Configure appropriate timeouts

#### LLM Provider Optimization
- [ ] Use appropriate models for cost/performance
- [ ] Configure retry strategies
- [ ] Implement fallback providers
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits

### 6. Operational Procedures

#### Deployment Process
- [ ] Use CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment
- [ ] Health check before traffic routing
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented

#### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Backup API keys and OAuth2 clients
- [ ] Document recovery procedures
- [ ] Test restore process

#### Maintenance
- [ ] Schedule for dependency updates
- [ ] Security patch process
