# A2A-Minions: Implementation Status

## Completed in This Session

### Error Handling & Data Validation
1. ✅ **Comprehensive Request Validation**
   - Created Pydantic models for all API inputs (`models.py`)
   - Added file size limits (50MB max)
   - Added content type validation (allowed MIME types)
   - Added text length limits (100k characters)
   - Proper validation error messages with 400 status codes

2. ✅ **Graceful Shutdown Implementation**
   - Added signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
   - Proper cleanup of active tasks with timeout
   - Temp file cleanup on shutdown
   - Server shutdown coordination with uvicorn

3. ✅ **Timeout Configuration**
   - Added configurable timeout in task metadata (10s to 1 hour)
   - Default timeout of 300 seconds
   - Proper timeout error handling and messaging
   - Timeout events sent via streaming

4. ✅ **Standardized Logging**
   - Replaced all print statements with logger calls
   - Consistent log format with timestamps
   - Proper log levels (info, warning, error)
   - Added debug logging for detailed tracing

5. ✅ **Task Cancellation**
   - Implemented proper task cancellation
   - Track active asyncio tasks
   - Cancel on user request or shutdown

### Project Structure Simplification
6. ✅ **Removed Standalone Project Files**
   - Removed `pyproject.toml`
   - Removed `__main__.py`
   - Created simple `requirements.txt`
   - Updated `__init__.py` to remove version info
   - Now works as part of main minions repo with `pip install -e .`

## Previously Fixed (From Earlier Session)

1. ✅ Missing PyPDF2 Dependency
2. ✅ Missing Skill ID Error Handling  
3. ✅ Path Traversal Vulnerability
4. ✅ Context Validation Logic Issue
5. ✅ Generic Exception Catching

## Remaining Issues

### High Priority
1. **Thread Safety Issue in Streaming Callback**
   - Still using `call_soon_threadsafe` with lambda
   - Should use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`

2. **Unbounded Task Storage Memory Leak**
   - Tasks stored indefinitely in memory
   - Need retention policy and cleanup mechanism

### Security
3. **No Authentication/Authorization**
   - Service completely open
   - Need API key validation

4. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Can be abused without limits

### Performance
5. **Synchronous File Operations** 
   - PDF extraction blocks event loop
   - Should use thread pool for CPU-intensive work

6. **No Connection Pooling**
   - Creates new clients for each request
   - Need client reuse mechanism

### Monitoring & Operations
7. **No Metrics or Monitoring**
   - Can't track service health
   - Need Prometheus metrics

8. **No Request Correlation**
   - Hard to trace requests
   - Need X-Request-ID support

9. **No Health Check with Dependencies**
   - Basic health check doesn't verify Minions availability

### Code Quality
10. **Missing Type Hints**
    - Some methods lack proper annotations

11. **No Structured Error Codes**
    - Using generic JSON-RPC error codes
    - Should have specific A2A error codes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Critical Bugs)
- Fix thread safety in streaming callback
- Implement task cleanup mechanism

### Short Term (Security & Reliability)
- Add authentication middleware
- Add connection pooling
- Move PDF processing to thread pool

### Long Term (Features)
- Add metrics and monitoring
- Implement distributed task storage
- Add request tracing
- Performance optimization
